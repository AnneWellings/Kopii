A small JUCE pattern delay plugin.

This is a VST plugin for making delay patterns. It goes according to the BPM and time signature of the DAW it is in, and will react to 4/4 and 3/4 time. It is only set up to work with those time signatures.

It has been tested, but it may still be buggy or crash.

This requires JUCE in order for it to be built: https://github.com/WeAreROLI/JUCE
